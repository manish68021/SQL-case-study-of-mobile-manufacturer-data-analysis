## Usage

1. **Connecting to the Database**:
   - Ensure you have the necessary SQL client installed.
   - Connect to the database using your credentials.

2. **Running Queries**:
   - You can run SQL queries to retrieve, manipulate, and analyze the data.
   - Example query to fetch customer transactions:

     ```sql
     SELECT 
         c.CustomerID, 
         c.FirstName, 
         c.LastName, 
         t.TransactionID, 
         t.TotalAmount, 
         d.Date
     FROM 
         FACT_TRANSACTIONS t
     JOIN 
         DIM_CUSTOMER c ON t.CustomerID = c.CustomerID
     JOIN 
         DIM_DATE d ON t.DateID = d.DateID
     WHERE 
         c.CustomerID = 1;
     ```

3. **Creating Reports**:
   - Use SQL queries to generate reports and insights based on the data.
   - Example report to get total sales by month:

     ```sql
     SELECT 
         d.Month, 
         d.Year, 
         SUM(t.TotalAmount) AS TotalSales
     FROM 
         FACT_TRANSACTIONS t
     JOIN 
         DIM_DATE d ON t.DateID = d.DateID
     GROUP BY 
         d.Month, d.Year
     ORDER BY 
         d.Year, d.Month;
     ```
